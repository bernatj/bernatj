## Hello, I'm Bernat Jiménez!

I am a **postdoctoral researcher** working on **weather and climate extremes** at the [Instituto de Geociencias (IGEO, UCM–CSIC)](https://igeo.ucm-csic.es/), within the *Physics of Climate and Global Change* group.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **climate dynamics and modelling**, spanning **weather to climate timescales**, with particular emphasis on the dynamical drivers of extreme events.

- I study the **predictability** and **climate-change response of atmospheric circulation and extremes**, combining:
  - **Physical models**, including Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems  
  - **Machine-learning–based atmospheric models**, which offer new opportunities to explore forecast skill, attribution, and storyline approaches

- A central theme of my work is the **subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) range** (≈2 weeks to several months), a regime characterized by **low but non-zero predictability** and often referred to as the *predictability desert*.

- I have extensive experience with **idealized numerical modelling**, which allows isolating and understanding key **physical mechanisms** underlying:
  - Large-scale teleconnections  
  - Atmospheric circulation anomalies  
  - Extreme events such as heatwaves and blocking

More broadly, I am interested in how advances in **AI-based weather prediction** can be combined with physical understanding to improve **process-based interpretation, attribution, and risk-relevant assessment of climate extremes**.
