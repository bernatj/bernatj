## Hello, I'm Bernat Jiménez!

- I'm a postdoctoral researcher working on weather and climate extremes at the [Instituto de Geociecias (UCM-CSIC)](https://igeo.ucm-csic.es/) in the Physics of Climate and Global Change group.

### Research Interests
- My interests and expertese revolve arround the field of c**limate dynamics and modelling**, from weather to climate timescales. 
- I am interested in using physical models (Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models) as well as newly developed **Machine Learning (ML)** atmospheric models to understand the **predictability** and **climate change impact on atmopsheric circulation and extremes**.
- I pay special interest on **subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)** timesecales (2 weeks to several months) as those show quite low predictability - know as predicatbility dessert.
- I have also extensive experience in running **idealized numerical models**, which help us to isolate **physical processes**, for example related to teleconnections or weather extremes.
